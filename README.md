# This is the v4beta development branch. ![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Eonasdan/bootstrap-datetimepicker.svg?branch=v4beta)

Please use [this jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/Eonasdan/0Ltv25o8/) to test your configurations.

Expect things to change as we are currently in the process of redesing API and behaviour for the component

For changelog have a look on [here](https://github.com/Eonasdan/bootstrap-datetimepicker/wiki/Version-4-changelog) and also on the commit history

In this version all the component interaction is made through the [Public API](https://github.com/Eonasdan/bootstrap-datetimepicker/wiki/Version-4-Public-API)

## Want to help us?

That would be great!

**We are currently in need for beta testers** to find issues that might have slipped.

Also if you have the guts we could use a hand writing test specs.

Have a look first [here](https://github.com/Eonasdan/bootstrap-datetimepicker/wiki/Version-4-Contributors-guide) as a supplement to the code

Also note that all PR's related to v4 should be made to ```v4beta``` branch and should pass the validations. Have a look at [here](https://github.com/Eonasdan/bootstrap-datetimepicker/blob/v4beta/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started. Remember to ```checkout v4beta```.

## Submitting Issues

Please test with the latest source code on this branch not the minified versions as they are outdated. Start your issue title with a ```v4:``` so it can be easily identified by the colaborators.
